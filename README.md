## Architecture

This project uses a layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns, making it easy to maintain and extend.

### Layer Design

- **cmd**: CLI command processing
- **internal/service**: Service layer, business logic processing
- **internal/repository**: Data access layer
- **internal/models**: Structure definitions
- **pkg**: Shared libraries
- **storage**: Persistent storage

## Testing

Run the test script:

```bash
./test_script.sh
```
